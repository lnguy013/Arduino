# utilizing Spectrum Analyzer Card to control WS2812B behavior 

- Music output from any device into spectrum analyzer 3.5 jack
- spectrum analyzer will analyze up to 7 spectrum. 
- we will use 3 of the spectrums each will generate different patterns base on level of volumne and how requently it is being triggered
- one will control LED half ball - randomize will look like sparkle disco ball
- one will control 2 LED tubes will look like music wave with random pattern controlled by the music not pre-determined
- one will control a small strip of LED that will flash to react to the bass.
- All paterns are controlled by the music and not pre-determine. This way we will be able to use any song and see unique patterns. 
  * If we play the same song the patterns should be the same each time.
