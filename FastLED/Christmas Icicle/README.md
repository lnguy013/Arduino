# First Attempt with FastLED single addressable LED patterns

- create a icicle effect that can simulate multiple iciles melting at the same time.

- Goal, learn the FastLED library and the Single Addressable LED behavior.


Needs improvment: icicle is not melting accurately. Some time it start at the wrong area and does not look like icicle.
